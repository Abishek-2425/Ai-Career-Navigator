@description Resume conversion utility script

This script was moved to the utilities/ directory as it's a standalone utility
that's not directly integrated with the Node.js backend.

Purpose: Convert resumes between different formats for processing
Future use: Can be integrated with the backend for preprocessing resumes before analysis
